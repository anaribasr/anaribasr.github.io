## 👩‍🔬 About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science passionate about bringing neuroscience and artificial intelligence together. My research focuses on developing **brain-like approaches to machine learning** by integrating insights from neuroscience into deep learning. Specifically, modeling another type of brain cell (astrocytes) and incorporating them into deep learning models to improve image classification as a new processing element.
